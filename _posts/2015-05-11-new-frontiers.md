There is something that has been amusing me about having a blog. I really
enjoy the idea of one, even if no-one is to read the things I have written.
Being able to share some shards of knowledge to some stray person wondering
in off of google is enough to bring a smile to my face.

However, keeping one up to date is another issue.

For the last three years I've been working as a consultant, and stubbornly
tackling both technical and organizational problems. Have learned a lot,
however it's really difficult for me to share those experiences without
fabricating completely phoney contexts in which to share them. Yuck! While
I would like to just be able to throw gag-orders under the bus, there has
been some other stuff occupying my time ...

Since ~October of last year, I've been working on [PitchPlay](https://pitchplay.io)
- a virtual music instructor. At the end of this month, I'll be making the switch
to work on it full time. Very excited!

I'd say head on over to [https://pitchplay.io](https://pitchplay.io) to learn
more, but realistically I've just been slaving away at the cool backend
we've got going on. In the coming months the site will be updated with more
information, so perhaps if you're a stray reading in the future who for some
reason cares about what this internet stranger has to say, you'll be able
to check it out.

Onwards and upwards as they say.

PS: I probably still won't update this very often. But my 
[github](https://github.com/Lykathia) will be a hell of a lot more active.
