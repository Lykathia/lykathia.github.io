  <h1>About Evan Lowry</h1>

  <p>
  Born and raised on the eastern shores of Nova Scotia, Evan is a polyglot programmer, developer advocate, problem solver, and lover of music.
  </p>

  <p>Evan's passions include code quality, craft beer, functional programming, philosophy, software development, technically challenging music, debugging, and listing things in no particular order.</p>

  Now that the formal stuff is out of the way. Hello reader. Welcome to this corner of the internet. I am sitting here writing this to myself, enjoying the beautiful syntax highlighting in vim and listening to music. Something about typing in a text editor is very cathartic.

  <p>
  I suppose I should say that I used to be involved in ACM competitive programming. Am pretty proud to be part of the 9-time first place regional championship team that was the SMU CS Huskies. Trained and competed with some incredibly talented people, learned a lot. (We won a bunch of things too)

  This is about as much talking about oneself as I can manage. Hit me up contact below, conversations are a lot more interesting than static web content.
